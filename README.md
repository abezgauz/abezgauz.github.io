CV for Employer
========================
About me
-------------------------
I like to do things not talk.
I won't leave the company in six months since another one offers the higher salary.
I highly appreciate stability, attach myself to the team (but probably this won’t be noticed by my future coworkers as I don’t like to chit-chat) and believe in the loyalty of the company which invests in me.

My philosophy
-------------------------
I’m convinced that separating events from the other ones is a path of oblivion and degradation and my science is an elusive horizon (piggy Waddles’ almost word for word quote).

It is always too early to be proud of project: pretty soon it will need optimization.

You can be proud of personality (your child as an option) but not of the fact that it simply cannot exist without you and your colleagues.

So this question is just a mask of another and  more intimate one: “Am I proud of myself?”

I always have the only answer to it

My skills
-------------------------
1. html/css bundling – the native tools of *nix-like (personal library of sh-scripts) + some npm packages are useful, such as sass (should not be mixed-up with node-sass), but there are plans to completely get off the js interpreter to solve issues outside of js bundlers...
2. ...js is collected by me with the use of a webpack (I appeal to gulp in a pinch when it is necessary to put the block elements in a string. Alas, I still can't do this).
3. Optimization of static type of images and videos: FFmpeg + web-interfaces.
4. Testing – once more native tools of *nix + dockers + virtual machines... Well, we also have a server room in the kitchen... Yeah. But the hood is good!
5. I have no constant IDE. I can hardly tell where I was 30 seconds ago, in a terminal or some GUI. My set is nano/vim/gedit/sublime text.
6. Years of experience allowed me to define other tools for solving various tasks. Avocode (all the power of Figma, Sketch, Adobe, etc.), Krita (which is not inferior to Photoshop and replaces the advantages of GIMP).
7. I love Git... Who doesn't?
8. I have worked with Jira.

Asked and answered
-------------------------
### About BEM...
Some of the BEM-ideas were reached by my personally. It is not strange because they are logical. However, in my opinion the complex use of BEM is suitable only for large projects. For smaller ones it has no factual basis.

### About Junior, middle, and lead...
Despite the fact that I am also fond of  ... philosophy, the concept of Senior seems strange to me. A Junior strives to become a Middle, the Middle doesn’t put up roadblocks by his inexperience (he mastered self-study), the Team Leader is ready for taking responsibility for everyone’s pot in his team and understands his own mistakes, not Michael’s (who hasn’t drunk enough coffee) ones. But what’s about Senior? Is he recovering faster and calling 5 supporters every 60 seconds? Are there 10 units of team spirit more in his presence? What about me, I believe that desire to be called the Senior matches the desire to have a certain middle point in my life. There is an entry point - the development of a programmer, as well as the end - his death. So where is the middle? How can I figure it out? Why should it be found? To sum up, the Senior is the Middle in a glossy cover

### About faith in experience...
Experience in the web teaches you to be adaptable * has laid flowers on the monument to Netscape*.

### About my attitude to the courses...
1) Any course as well as the coordinate device is just the secondary tool that causes dependence;

2) the course may be convenient for pre-familiarization with the product documentation, but more often it doesn’t worth my money;

3) the very beginners should not learn using the courses. If there is no basic knowledge, everything the speaker says becomes it. You should trust your training only to yourself, listening to advice, googling the tips and then testing them.

### About the near future...
I'm not going to expand anywhere in the near future as I can hardly fit into the imagination of my fans.

### About the distant future...
In the distant future (when my child will provide for himself) I will be able to bail on money and disappear in the administration of servers (I enjoy the front and children, but for some reason there is more fun with children, although the sandboxes are painfully similar).
